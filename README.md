In short, the simplest reinforcment learning framework involves an agent interacting with the environment. At each time step, the agent observes the **state** of the environment, choose valid **action** and receive **reward** from the environment. The interaction between the agent and the environment forms a sequence of s<sub>0</sub>            (s - states,a - action,r - reward)
