In short, the simplest reinforcment learning framework involves an agent interacting with the environment. At each time step, the agent observes the **state** of the environment, choose valid **action** and receive **reward** from the environment. The interaction between the agent and the environment forms a sequence of $$s_0,a_0,r_1,s_1,a_1,r_2,...s_T,r_T$$(s - states,a - action,r - reward)
